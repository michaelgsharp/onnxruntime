        - DirGenerator:             Method to enumerate sub-directories when searching for scripts in a
                                    repository's Scripts directory.

        - CreateCommands:           Method that creates the shell commands to invoke a script.

        - CreateDocumentation:      Method that extracts documentation from a script.

                                        def Func(script_filename) -> documentation string

        - ScriptNameDecorator:      Returns a new name for the script.
